OracleJdbcTpch
==============

This is a java file that connects to an Oracle database. This database is based on a smaller version of the TPC-H benchmark database. I use JDBC to connect to the database then I query and print the table and view metadata. Finally I run some queries against the database and print the results. This shows my understanding of SQL, JDBC, Oracle, and databases. To run this you need Oracle installed. To run this run the run.sql file inside of oracle to automatically create all the tables, views, and insert all of the table data. Then simply compile both the .java files and run the JDBCExample.java file. It will ask you for your Oracle username and password when running. I also included a JDBCExampleResults.txt file if you just want to see what the results of the file print without going through the compile and run process.
